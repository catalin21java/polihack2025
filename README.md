# StepN'Up: Sustainable Mobility & Wellness Platform

## üåç Project Overview

StepN'Up is an innovative web platform that encourages eco-friendly transportation and sustainable living by gamifying urban mobility. Our application bridges the gap between personal wellness, environmental consciousness, and local business engagement through an immersive, interactive experience.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Globe:** Explore eco-friendly cities worldwide through a beautifully rendered THREE.js powered 3D globe
- **Reward Ecosystem:** Earn eco-points for sustainable transportation choices redeemable at local businesses
- **Wellness Dashboard:** Track health metrics, set goals, and monitor your eco-impact
- **Immersive City Experiences:** Discover cities through interactive animations (like our signature Vespa tour of Italy)
- **QR Code Redemption System:** Seamlessly claim rewards at partner businesses
- **Responsive UI:** Beautiful, consistent design across all viewports and devices

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Frontend Technologies
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Custom-built application with zero bloat for optimal performance
- **HTML5/CSS3:** Utilizing modern web standards including CSS Grid, Flexbox, and custom properties
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

### 3D Rendering & Animation
- **THREE.js:** Powers our interactive globe with custom shaders and optimized rendering
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** Complex, scroll-triggered animations with precise timing
- **ScrollTrigger Plugin:** Advanced scroll-based interactions and timeline control
- **DrawSVG Plugin:** SVG path animations for engaging visual elements
- **GLTF Loader:** Efficient loading and rendering of 3D models (Vespa scooter, globe markers)

### Dynamic Interface
- **Custom Scroll Physics:** Momentum-based scrolling with inertia for natural feel
- **Dynamic Data Rendering:** City/business data dynamically generated with optimized DOM manipulation
- **Custom Modal System:** Lightweight, accessible modal implementation for offers and city information

### APIs & Integration
- **QR Code Generation API:** Dynamic QR code creation for reward redemption
- **City Data API:** Rich dataset of global city information with sustainability metrics
- **Health Data Integration:** Ready-to-connect interfaces for popular fitness tracking platforms

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading:** Images and 3D assets load only when needed
- **Canvas Management:** Intelligent canvas rendering lifecycle to minimize memory usage
- **Optimized Asset Pipeline:** Compressed textures and efficient model loading

### Security & Accessibility
- **WCAG Compliance:** Accessible design with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- **Secure Token System:** Fraud-resistant reward redemption process
- **Cross-browser Compatibility:** Tested across all modern browsers

## üí° Technical Highlights

### Interactive Globe Implementation
Our globe leverages THREE.js with custom shaders and optimized render loops. The city markers are dynamically positioned using spherical coordinate mapping with precise geo-positioning algorithms. The integration with creme.png background textures demonstrates our attention to design cohesion.

### Advanced Animation Sequencing
The Italy Vespa tour showcases our mastery of the GSAP animation platform. We've implemented a complex, scroll-driven animation sequence that renders a 3D Vespa model with physically accurate movements. The animation intelligently responds to scroll speed, creating a natural, immersive experience while maintaining performance.



## üîç Future Development

- **Machine Learning Integration:** Predictive eco-route suggestions based on user behavior
- **Expanded City Database:** Adding more cities with curated sustainable experiences
- **AR Features:** Augmented reality city exploration
- **Social Networking:** Community challenges and group achievements
